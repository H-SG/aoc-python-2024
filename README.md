# AOC 2024
Another year, another advent of code. It's a very busy time right now, so I won't be doing anything fancy, just doing the usual on Python. As usual I will be trying to limit myself to the standard set of libraries.

## Day 1
EZ GG. Just some list manipulation and trivial use of built in list manipulation functions.

## Day 2
Part 1 was pretty easy, but then fell into the trap of premature optimisation. Part 2 complexity is O(5n) when brute forcing. It's trivial.

Anyway, I did try to make it a bit more efficient.
