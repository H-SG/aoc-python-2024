Another year, another advent of code. It's a very busy time right now, so I won't be doing anything fancy, just doing the usual on Python. As usual I will be trying to limit myself to the standard set of libraries.

## Day 1
EZ GG. Just some list manipulation and trivial use of built in list manipulation functions.

## Day 2
Part 1 was pretty easy, but then fell into the trap of premature optimisation. Part 2 complexity is O(5n) when brute forcing. It's trivial.

Anyway, I did try to make it a bit more efficient.

## Day 3
REGEXES BABBAY. Nice easy one.

## Day 4
Why did I decide to rotate the arrays, this is so ugly, urgh. It works though

## Day 5
Sets and recursion, I like this solution. Clean, precise, good.

I'm very surprised that almost everything worked first time without tweaking. I was sure my inserts were going to need more index tweaking. I think, depending on my input set the recursion could go endlessly, but, unlikely, maybe.
